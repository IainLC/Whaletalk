#Task
+ Practice looping and printing to the console in JavaScript.
Take a phrase like ‘turpentine and turtles’ and translate it into its “whale talk” equivalent: ‘UUEEIEEAUUEE’. 

#Criteria

+ Get accurate results when converting
+ There are no consonants. Only vowels excluding “y”.
+ The u‘s and e‘s are extra long, so we must double them in our program.
